# Position des adverbes (Position of adverbs)

- Adverbs usually follow verbs
```
-je vais rarement au théâtre(I rarely go to the theatre)
-comme vous cinduisez prudemment!(you do drive carefully!)
```

- With compound tenses, shorter adverbs usually come between the auxiliary and the past participle

*Note: auxiliary verb is a verb that is used with another verb to form tenses, negatives, and questions. In English the auxiliary verbs are 'be', 'have', and 'do'*
```
-j'ai enfin terminé(I have finished at last)
-nous y sommes souvent allés(we have often gone there)
-il me l'a déjà dit(he already told me)
-elle avait beaucoup souffert(she had suffered a lot)
```

- Adverbs of place and time many follow the past participle
```
-je l'ai rencontré hier(I ment him yesterday)
-elle avait cherché partout(she looked everywhere)
-mettez-le dehor(put it outsisde)
-tu t'es couché tard?(did you go to bed late?)
```
- Adverbs usually come before adjectives or other adverbs

```
-trés rarement(very rarely)
-trop vite(too quickly)
-elle est vraiment belle(she is really beautiful)
```

## Moods

Verb moods are classifications that indicate the attitude of the speaker. Grammatical mood is a form of verb used to refer to the quality of the verb in the sentence. It also indicates the tone of a verb in a sentence.

- Indicative Mood
    This mood is used to express a fact statement. The verb in the indicative mood expresses an action as a statement of fact.
    ```
    -Elle aime le cadeau(She likes the gift)
    -Il cuisine toujours ses repas(He always cooks his meals)
    ```
- Imperative Mood (more in chapter 8.)
    This mood is used to express a command or a request statement. The tone of the sentence is a direct command, not a suggestion.
    ```
    -Range ta chambre(Clean your room)
    ```
- Interrogative Mood
    This mood is used to express a sense of uncertainty by asking a question. The question contains an auxiliary verb (helping verb) and then a main verb.
    ```
    -Vous venez au camp d'été?(Are you coming to the summer camp?)
    ```
- Conditional Mood (more in chapter 8.)
    This mood is used to express a condition statement. The sentence contains an auxiliary verb (helping verb) that supports a main verb.
    ```
    -Si vous voulez rendre visite à vos amis, vous devriez étudier maintenant(If you want to visit your friends, you should study now)
    ```

- Subjunctive Mood (more in chapter 8.)
    This mood is used to express a wish, doubt, demand, or a hypothetical situation. The verb in the subjunctive mood always changes.
    ```
    -Si j'étais dans sa situation, je ne conduirais jamais(If I were in her situation, I would never drive)
    ```
